					A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific operation. or computer is a computational device that is used to process the data under the control of a computer program. While executing the program, raw data is processed into the desired output format. These computer programs are written in a programming language which are high-level languages. High level languages are nearly human languages that are more complex than the computer understandable language which are called machine language, or low level language.

				<h2>PYTHON</h2>
                <hr>
				    <p>python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.</p>
                    <p>Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation[34].</p>
                    <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.</p>
                    <p>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.</p>
                    <p>It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[35][36]</p>
                    <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[37]</p>
                    <p>Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[38]</p>
                    <p>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

				<h2>C</h2>
                <hr>
					<p>C is an imperative, procedural language in the ALGOL tradition. </p>
                    <p>It has a static type system. In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines (also called "functions", though not in the sense of functional programming). </p>
                    <p>Function parameters are passed by value, although arrays are passed as pointers, i.e. the address of the first item in the array. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointers to the thing being referenced.</p>
                    <p>C program source text is free-form code. </p>
                    <p>Semicola terminate statements, while curly braces are used to group statements into blocks.</p>

				<h2>RUBY</h2>
                <hr>
					<p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. </p>
                    <p>It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. </p>
                    <p>In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. </p>
                    <p>It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.</p>
                    <p>Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, Java, and Lisp[10][3] .</p>

				<h2>PHP</h2>
                <hr>
				<p>PHP is a server-side scripting language, which is used to design the dynamic web applications with MySQL database.</p>
                <p>It handles dynamic content, database as well as session tracking for the website.</p>
                <p>You can create sessions in PHP.</p>
                <p>It can access cookies variable and also set cookies.</p>
                <p>It helps to encrypt the data and apply validation.</p>
                <p>PHP supports several protocols such as HTTP, POP3, SNMP, LDAP, IMAP, and many more.</p>
                <p>Using PHP language, you can control the user to access some pages of your website.</p>
                <p>As PHP is easy to install and set up, this is the main reason why PHP is the best language to learn.</p>
                <p>PHP can handle the forms, such as - collect the data from users using forms, save it into the database, and return useful information to the user. For example - Registration form. </p>
